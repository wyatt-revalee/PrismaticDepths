# PrismaticDepths
 A rework/refactor/continuation of my Unity game
 The first version had many flaws at its core - this version seeks to address those by giving every little mechanic the proper long-term treatment.

 About

    GamePlay
        - Highlights
            - Multi-wave hack & slash
            - Fluid, responsive movement system
            - Rogue-like item system
        - Description
            - I want to implement gameplay of something like Risk of Rain's stages and items, with Hollow Knight's fluid movement and combat.
            Players will progress through waves, fighting new monsters, obtaining new items and abilities, and getting stronger. 
    
    Music
        - Probably synth, retro-y?
        - This can be filled out later as I figure out what I want the sound to be.

    Setting
        - Some kind of alternate space separated from 'reality' whatever that may be for the pc.
        - Trials of a sort to gain power? Or perhaps save something.
        - Labrynth of increasingly difficult monsters.
    
    Combat
        - Hack & Slash incorporating abilities/magic
        - Similar to Hollow Knight but incorporating more diverse elements
        - Fast, responsive, skill-rewarding.
